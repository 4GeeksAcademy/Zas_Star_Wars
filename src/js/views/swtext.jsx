                        <p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…</p>
                        
                        <p>The galaxy was torn apart by the battle between light and darkness. The Galactic Republic, once a symbol of peace, fell into corruption. The Sith, thought to be extinct, returned under the guise of Senator Palpatine, secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious. He orchestrated the Clone Wars, a conflict that weakened the Republic and allowed him to seize power, declaring himself Emperor and forming the tyrannical Galactic Empire.

                        <p> Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi destined to bring balance to the Force, fell to the dark side, consumed by fear of losing his wife, Padmé. Manipulated by Palpatine, he became Darth Vader and helped destroy the Jedi Order. Padmé died giving birth to twins, Luke and Leia, who were hidden to protect them from their father.

                        <p> Years later, Luke discovered his heritage and joined the Rebel Alliance, led by Leia. Together with Han Solo and Chewbacca, they struck a major blow by destroying the Death Star. Luke trained as a Jedi and confronted Darth Vader, learning he was his father. Refusing to give up on him, Luke inspired Vader to turn against Palpatine, sacrificing himself to save his son and restore balance.
